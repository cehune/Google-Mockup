# Google Mockup

This project can be seen at (https://disagreeable-chicken.surge.sh/search)

It is a Google Clone, fit with a search function and the ability to see the main results, related news, videos, and images. 

This is a guided project by JavaScript Mastery. I modified it based on the React Router update to V6, and the updates to the Google API.
